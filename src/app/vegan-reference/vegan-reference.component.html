    <p>You'll also be surprised at how much you just don't need eggs for. Some recipes are fine if you just remove the
        egg
        altogether — such is the case with <a href="#/recipe/1265">Latkes.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also get creative with other substitutes like vinegar, vegan buttermilk, and other pureed fruits like
        avocado. One time I even made a cake with pepsi instead of egg and milk. It wasn't the most flavorful cake but
        it
        worked!

        Below are the most common substitutes we use.
