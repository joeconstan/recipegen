      You'll be surprised at how much you just don't need eggs for. Some recipes
      are totally fine if you just remove the egg altogether — such is the case
      with <a href="#/recipe/1265">Latkes.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also get creative with other substitutes like vinegar, vegan
      buttermilk, and other pureed fruits like avocado. One time I even made a
      cake with pepsi instead of egg and milk. It wasn't the most flavorful cake
      but it worked!

    <p>Below are the most common substitutes we use.</p>

      When it comes to marinating tofu, you can play around with the ingredients to find your perfect blend of flavors.
      However, choosing at least one from each group below gives a perfect balance of flavors for your marinated tofu.
      Adjust your choices to cater for your own taste preferences,
      or those of your guests, the region around the world your dish originates from, or at
      times (if you are anything like us) simply whatever you can find in the cupboard!

          <td>The oil, olive, sesame, groundnut or other fat such as soya yogurt or coconut milk will help the other flavors infuse and help the tofu to crisp when cooking </td>

          <td>Acid</td>
          <td>Acts as an enzyme that allows the ingredients to mingle. Includes citrus juices such as lemon, lime, orange, wine, or vinegar such as balsamic, red wine, apple cider.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Salty-Sweet</td>

        You are now ready to start cooking, you can cook the marinated tofu any way you like; bake, grill, barbeque, shallow or deep fry or griddle.
        If you are baking, think 180 deg C. for 35 minutes, turning halfway through. You can also add the tofu marinade to the dish you're cooking to act as a sauce; the tofu will continue to absorb flavor as it cooks.
        If you are barbecuing or grilling, brush your tofu with the extra marinade as it cooks to increase the flavor.
        Avoid adding salt directly to your marinade, use tamari or soy sauce, capers, miso or olives, as an alternative way to provide the salty taste as regular salt can quickly overwhelm your marinade and extract moisture from the tofu rather than introduce flavor.
        If you have any tofu marinade left, the good news is, as all the ingredients above are plant-based, you can re-use it for another few days so you are covered for tomorrow's kebabs, and the next day's roasted veg (just keep it in the fridge). Hooray.
